# PHPBridge curriculum-related FAQ

### Can I use the PHPBridge curricula at my event?
Anyone can use this site! It's under a Creative Commons license ([CC-BY,  specifically](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)), which means you're welcome to share, remix, or use our content commercially. In fact,
we are based on the fantastic work done by [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org).

Slightly different: if you're organizing an event and wonder if it could be considered a PHPBridge Workshop, we just have two requests:

* The event should be free of charge.
* The event should work toward making tech more welcoming!

If you're not doing those two things, you can totally still use the site, we just ask that you not call your event a PHPBridge workshop.
(For example you can use "PHP Workshop featuring the PHPBridge curriculum".)

### I want to help, but I don't know how.
First, [make a GitHub account](https://github.com/). Then, [create an issue](https://github.com/phpbridge/docs/issues) with the idea you have. We'll help you turn it into reality (assuming it's in line with our lofty goals :D).

Don't know what you could work on? Browse the [issues list](https://github.com/phpbridge/docs/issues) for ideas.


### I have different question about PHPBridge.
The [PHPBridge website](http://www.phpbridge.org) probably has an answer!
