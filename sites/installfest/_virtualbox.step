  VirtualBox is a tool that allows you to create virtual computers running their own
  operating system, and that you can safely play around in without worrying about
  breaking your actual computer.

  VirtualBox is free (as in beer) and open source, you can find more information at
  <https://www.virtualbox.org>.
