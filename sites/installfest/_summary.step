    You now have a fully functional Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine on which to complete the PHPBridge curriculum, *congrats!*

    Additionally, you have the Sublime Text editor in which to write your code.

    You will perform the majority of the curriculum either inside Sublime Text, or inside the Virtual Machine in a terminal.
